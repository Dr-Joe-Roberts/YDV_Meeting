# YDV Meeting (University of Liverpool: 2024-04-08) 
* Could an opinion piece form an output from this meeting?
* Pull together a funding proposal.


## Trisna Tungadi (Keele)
* Endosymbionts are the primary focus.
* How does endosymbiont infection influence aphid odour profiles? <- is this an alternative diagnostic mechanism / how does this impact biological control?
* What are the trade-offs between virus infection and insecticide resistance? (w/ Chris Bass).
* Is Blackgrass a host for YVD? (Royal Society funded). Discuss with John Reade. No evidence that aphids use this as a host, but Rothamsted have tested this and their evidence suggests that this is possible. As Blackgrass are small plants they become overwhelmed very easily. 
* Bird cherry-oat aphid culture infected with BYDV.
