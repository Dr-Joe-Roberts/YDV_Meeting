# YDV Meeting (University of Liverpool: 2024-04-08) 
* Could an opinion piece form an output from this meeting? *Current Opinion in Insect Science* as an option. 
* Pull together a funding proposal.
* BYDV-PAS seems to be emerging...


## Trisna Tungadi (Keele)
* Endosymbionts are the primary focus.
* How does endosymbiont infection influence aphid odour profiles? <- is this an alternative diagnostic mechanism / how does this impact biological control?
* What are the trade-offs between virus infection and insecticide resistance? (w/ Chris Bass).
* Is Blackgrass a host for YVD? (Royal Society funded). Discuss with John Reade. No evidence that aphids use this as a host, but Rothamsted have tested this and their evidence suggests that this is possible. As Blackgrass are small plants they become overwhelmed very easily. 
* Bird cherry-oat aphid culture infected with BYDV.

## Katherine Preedy (JHI/BIOSS)
* Landscape scale arrival of aphids using GAMs. Location, year, north atlantic oscillation and cumulative temperature effects. Collated datasets. (w/ David Miller and Ken Newman). Predicting pest arrival. Cold in past = lag, cold in present = no lag.
* Field scale space and competition modelled in Julia (population model). This programme is available on request - could we collaborate on this? Computationally expensive to run - will take a while. Doesn't include probability for virus transmission. 
* Systems scale parasitoid control. Parasitoids can differentiate between uninfected and H. defensa infected aphid hosts.
* Large focus on Scottish suction sampling data.

## Lawrence Bramham (Rothamsted)
* EPG work has highlighted that aphids do not like feeding on resistant wheat (MRD049). This line is part of the wheat genetic improvement network.
* Lots of genotyping work has been carried out. qPCR is traditional but they have moved to a new genomics platform (X9) - you get up to 9216 qPCR assays per run (2 hours). Uses microfluidics to run simultaneous qPCR analyses.
* Very limited UK-specific BYDV sequencing data. This makes understanding strain variation difficult. Very low numbers of sequences available in NCBI database. Some BYDV-PAV strains are missed through classic diagnostics. Conserved SNPs have been identified - new methodologies have been developed, included Taq-Man. 
* BYDV-PAS found in R. padi and S. avenae. <- this is interesting! Is thought to outcompete other BYDV strains. This may cause issues for plant breeding companies. Is working with RAGT seeds to understand BYDV resistance. 
* Wants to use the Rothamsted Insect Survey samples more. Feels as if this data is wasted. Routine BYDV detection is quite low 12-33% across suction traps, but this might be due to analysis potential.
