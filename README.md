# YDV Meeting (University of Liverpool: 2024-04-08) 
* Could an opinion piece form an output from this meeting? *Current Opinion in Insect Science* as an option. 
* Pull together a funding proposal.
* BYDV-PAS seems to be emerging within the UK (already found in Poland)...


## Trisna Tungadi (Keele)
* Endosymbionts are the primary focus.
* How does endosymbiont infection influence aphid odour profiles? <- is this an alternative diagnostic mechanism / how does this impact biological control?
* What are the trade-offs between virus infection and insecticide resistance? (w/ Chris Bass).
* Is Blackgrass a host for YVD? (Royal Society funded). Discuss with John Reade. No evidence that aphids use this as a host, but Rothamsted have tested this and their evidence suggests that this is possible. As Blackgrass are small plants they become overwhelmed very easily. 
* Bird cherry-oat aphid culture infected with BYDV.

## Katherine Preedy (JHI/BIOSS)
* Landscape scale arrival of aphids using GAMs. Location, year, north atlantic oscillation and cumulative temperature effects. Collated datasets. (w/ David Miller and Ken Newman). Predicting pest arrival. Cold in past = lag, cold in present = no lag.
* Field scale space and competition modelled in Julia (population model). This programme is available on request - could we collaborate on this? Computationally expensive to run - will take a while. Doesn't include probability for virus transmission. 
* Systems scale parasitoid control. Parasitoids can differentiate between uninfected and H. defensa infected aphid hosts.
* Large focus on Scottish suction sampling data.

## Lawrence Bramham (Rothamsted)
* EPG work has highlighted that aphids do not like feeding on resistant wheat (MRD049). This line is part of the wheat genetic improvement network.
* Lots of genotyping work has been carried out. qPCR is traditional but they have moved to a new genomics platform (X9) - you get up to 9216 qPCR assays per run (2 hours). Uses microfluidics to run simultaneous qPCR analyses.
* Very limited UK-specific BYDV sequencing data. This makes understanding strain variation difficult. Very low numbers of sequences available in NCBI database. Some BYDV-PAV strains are missed through classic diagnostics. Conserved SNPs have been identified - new methodologies have been developed, included Taq-Man. 
* BYDV-PAS found in R. padi and S. avenae. <- this is interesting! Is thought to outcompete other BYDV strains. This may cause issues for plant breeding companies. Is working with RAGT seeds to understand BYDV resistance. Mixed infections more likely than recognised.
* Wants to use the Rothamsted Insect Survey samples more. Feels as if this data is wasted. Routine BYDV detection is quite low 12-33% across suction traps, but this might be due to analysis potential.
* Different aphid species preferentially carry different BYDV strains. Is this seasonal or because the strains are co-infecting plants and found in different plant parts? 

## Sam Telling (ADAS)
* AHDB funded project to develop an effective (and cheap!) BYDV monitoring tool/service. Suction traps are reliable for percentage BYDV, but only for farms less than 20 km from the trap. Water traps are also good.
* Same project also looked at developing a DSS each for risk and spray. Validated in tramline trials to determine accuracy. It is accurate in untreated crops and can be used to adjust drill date. Comparable to existing AHDB T-sum tool.
* Tolerant varieties performed well in field trials.
* IPM works found low levels of BYDV across field sites despite it being predicted to be a high risk year in 2022. Looking at this again in 2023 with a broader number of partners but replacing risk adverse (4 sprays) with ACroBAT model.
* ADAS work on a lot of industry funded trials - data cannot be shown due to confidentiality.
